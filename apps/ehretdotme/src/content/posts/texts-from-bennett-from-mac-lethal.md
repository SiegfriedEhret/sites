## Mac Lethal ?

> Mac Lethal, is an indie hip hop artist from Kansas City, Missouri. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Lethal))

I am not sure when I discovered Mac Lethal stuff. I think it was with his [11:11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11:11_%28Mac_Lethal_album%29). 3 albums, lots of mixtapes and EPs, all good stuff. You can listen to it [here](http://maclethal.bandcamp.com/).

This song, from Irish Goodbye, his last album, is amazing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2aD5G9B74s

He is also famous for his fast raps, for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcFyX2o9zoo

I am not an expert at all in hip hop, but I think this pale kid raps good. I like his songs, which are always nicely written, with an amazing mix of humour and emotions, sad stories etc.

## Who is Bennett ?

[Texts from Bennett](http://textsfrombennett.tumblr.com/) is a blog where Mac Lethal shared conversations with his cousin Bennett.

> Bennet, his wannabe gansta cousin, is seventeen, uses drugs and foul language, claims to be 13 percent black, and swears he speaks "da female language." (Strangely that last one sort of seems true). (back cover of the book)

## The book

The book is not _only_ about Bennett. It is about a period in the life of Mac Lethal, when his cousin Bennett and Aunt Lily came to live in his house... With their problems (and their solutions ?)

The book is **not** a blog copycat. You will find lots of conversations between Mac Lethal and Bennett, and you will meet some members of the family, and their friends, their girlfriends.

Also, thou shalt always remember **BENNETT DA BOSS HOGGZ 11 COMMANDMINTS OF GITTIN' BITCHEZ**.

### A note from the bereaved

Sorry for copying it here, but this is one of the most emotional part of the book, I love it, and I had to copy it here:

> When a person is so important to you that his or her death, in turn, causes the residual death of a piece of you - you never quite find a way to heal from it. You try to blend different analgesics and numbing agents to block the pain signals from traveling to your endorphin receptors; you try to mix various medicines and elixirs to war with the immortal virii it leaves orphaned inside of you, coursing through you body's elaborate network of fragile arteries and throbbing vessels; but overall, it's a lifelong experience that has only one remedy: acceptance.

## Conclusion

The book is fun, touching, and presents a nice story. I do not care if everything Mac Lethal says is real (I think it is). The book is amazing, go read it.

I can't wait to see what happens with this: [FX Buys Odd Couple Comedy From Randall Einhorn](http://www.deadline.com/2013/11/fx-buys-odd-couple-comedy-from-randall-einhorn/).
