[FirefoxOS](https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/os/) is (was ?) a mobile device experiment.

Recently, they announced:

> We will make space for this [IoT] exploration by stopping our work to build and ship smartphones through carrier partners.<br>
> &mdash; [source](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/12/09/firefox-os-pivot-to-connected-devices/)

## FirefoxOS devices

Disclaimer: I haven't tried to install it on a real device (middle/high-end one).

I tried the following phones:

- Geeksphone Keon
- Geeksphone Peak
- Alcatel OneTouch Fire

They all suck. Seriously. Even basic Android phones that are as cheap and offer better performances.

## The OS

Mozilla made an amazing thing enabling the devices possibilities to be used from a web app.

Compared to the two (Android and iOS, I have not tried Windows Mobile), the platform is waaaayyy behind.

- The stability was really bad (I only played with v1.x)
- Everything is a web app (no possibility to run native apps)
- Available applications

## So what ?

FirefoxOS is a «WEB APP ALL THE THINGS» OS only, and I think they killed themselves not allowing «native apps» on mobiles.

It may be a good move to apply FirefoxOS to other things.
