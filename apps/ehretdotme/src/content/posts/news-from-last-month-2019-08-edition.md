Interesting piece of advice [found on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/cer80o/lpt_the_biggest_communication_problem_is_that_we/):

> LPT: The biggest communication problem is that we don't listen to understand. We listen to reply. When in an argument, put your anger aside and actually try to empathise with the other person, so as to defuse the situation.
