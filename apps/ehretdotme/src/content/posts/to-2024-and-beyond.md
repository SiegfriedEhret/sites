Hello folks, I hope you are doing well.

## Work

I planned to look into data management and pipelines. I did that with my 2 colleagues (the tech team is still small). We used [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) (the [Google Cloud version](https://cloud.google.com/composer)), so I had to get into Python. I am not really into that language. Luckily we can use Airflow to orchestrate Docker images so we can code our tasks in other languages.

We had a lovely intern (coucou Noah‚ÄØ!) who made an amazing job to create the [CyberPeace Miners](https://miners.cyberpeaceinstitute.org/), a map to explain some cybersecurity concepts in Minecraft. I made the website and some tooling around the project which ended up being not used (on-demand server creation and auto-removal after 30 minutes, all on Kubernetes).

I also had to take the harsh decision to stop the internship of another intern.

We released a new report (see [CyberPeace Analytical Report: - NGOs serving Humanity at risk: Cyber Threats affecting "International Geneva" | CyberPeace Institute](https://geneva.cyberpeace.ngo/)). I made the website, and it was my first experience playing with [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial).

In 2024 the dev team will grow, I can‚Äôt wait!

## Not work

Tough year was tough.

Ayako (I am her husband) was pregnant and we learnt in June that nothing was there. This is called a [blighted ovum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blighted_ovum). I think I got a small depression following that. Ayako was under the side effects of the pregnancy and did not feel it as strongly as I did. After a few months, we are now back to our normal state. I asked an AI to create an image to represent that, the result is the image at the top (I also used it for [News from last month (2023/07 edition)](https://ehret.me/news-from-last-month-202307-edition) when we got the news).

On top of that, and unrelated, I discovered 2 things regarding family members:

- They are just people
- It is ok to cut ties

On the nerdy side, I changed (again) the tools I use for my websites, I added some details at [beulogue v4](https://ehret.me/beulogue-v4), and more recently trying to bring back content to the repository, as I described in [Tina ü¶ô](https://ehret.me/tina).

I also made an advent calendar on my French website, the posts are available at [sieg.fr/ied/tag/avent-2023](https://sieg.fr/ied/tag/avent-2023).

I think I‚Äôll continue to publish my "News from last month" posts, but I hope to make them a bit shorter (meaning I will sleep more and spend less time on the Internet).

I am still thinking about trying other format for some specific things. These will be in French.

And I continued to make biscuits and cakes, I have a huge book with some nice recipes. I need a bigger kitchen.

I cycled a bit more this year. Not often, but long rides. It felt good. I did the [tour du L√©man](https://www.komoot.com/fr-fr/tour/1211931665) (167km), went to [the Sal√®ve and in the countryside](https://www.komoot.com/fr-fr/tour/1313191323) (83km), and to [Martigny](https://www.komoot.com/fr-fr/tour/1328745883) (133km). In 2024 I want to make a 200km ride because why not.

And we moved Ayako‚Äôs email out of Gmail to a Fastmail account (if you want one, [click my referral link!](https://ref.fm/u10904521)). Amazing!

## Travels

We went to Japan to see the family. We went to Tokyo and Kyoto. Here is a view of the [torii gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torii) in Fushimi Inari-taisha:

The aquarium in Kyoto is great! Here is a picture of me and my daughter:

We also went to Chamonix to celebrate the 2 years of our daughter, we had a nice view:

Also: Brussels (where I did some babysitting while Ayako gave a course), Burgundy and Paris to meet some friends, Saillon to enjoy a nice restaurant and the pool with our daughter, and Nice for Christmas

### Books

I have not read much books this year, I spend to much time reading stuff on the Internet. I already have some on my bookshelf waiting for me :).

My favorite book of the year is [The Suitcase by Chris Naylor-Ballesteros](https://nosycrow.com/product/the-suitcase/).

### Games

Last year I started GTA5, and I did continue playing a bit but the progress is very slow.

Since we played some Minecraft at work, I played some Minecraft at home. And I defeated the Ender Dragon! (I bought Minecraft 12 years ago ^^).

I don‚Äôt have much time to play but my birthday is coming soon and I would love a Steam Deck.

## Happy new year!

2023 was quite a terrible year. Here‚Äôs to continuing the trend for 2024! Cheers!

About new year resolution, I will try a pizza with some ananas to finally see if it is good or bad. I need to know.

A song for you: [Aesop Rock - Pigeonometry (Official Audio) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf0poQI8wSo)
