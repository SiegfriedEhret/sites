[Hello, is it me you're looking for?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHONNcZbwDY) I hope you are doing well.

## Work

I joined the [CyberPeace Institute](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) at the end of 2020 and I am learning a lot since I joined! I am part of a team with various expertises (cybercrime investigators, digital forensics experts etc.) which is quite fascinating. I think that officially we say  that we "develop an innovative analytical framework and forensics capabilities".

I have been involved in multiple subjects, for example:

* Helped with the tools selection for the framework.
* Worked on [Cyber Incident Tracer #HEALTH](https://cit.cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) and super happy with my dev buddy who took care of the charts part of the website!
* Set up CI/CD with GitLab Pipelines (I spent weeks on that).
* Contributed to Helm packages for 3rd party apps (for example [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/), [OpenCTI](https://www.opencti.io/en/)).
* Development of a few internal apps.

And helped other teams:
* Helped a lot with the website (yes, WordPress!): digged many performance issues, did a lot of cleaning.
* Played a lot with Jira to create boards.
* Created some scraping script to pull some data.

On the dev side:

* For our APIs, we use [Go](https://go.dev/). It is the language at the intersection of multiple persons, I may explore other languages secretly in 2022.
* For our web applications, we are focusing on [React](https://reactjs.org/)  and I use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) / [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) for my mini-projects.
* We use multiple storage for our data, particularly [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/) which is nice until you try to connect something to it, oh wait you can't because no jdbc.
* We are on GCP, and I am quite happy because we will try a smaller provider (ExoScale).

And I survived Kubernetes! Many thanks to some old friends (Papy, Prune, Vincent, Kaneda) for their precious help!

## Not work

I killed [some](https://ehret.me/en/brrr-the-end) [projects](https://ehret.me/en/beulogue-the-end) and secretly retarted [one of them](https://git.sr.ht/~siegfriedehret/brrr). Still playing with [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) and enjoying my first steps with [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/).

For the web, I am still in love with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), and curious about [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/). The JavaScript landscape is quite exciting and I hope for a replacement of the classic trio Angular / React / Vue. Anyway, everybody relies on jQuery in the real world...

About this website:

* Moved to [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) + [Contentful](https://contentful.com) after killing beulogue.
* I started a [Museum of Poorly Photographed Art](https://ehret.me/museum) to remove the dust from pictures I take when I visit museums. I will add more content in 2022.
* I added a "[badidon](https://ehret.me/badidon)" section (in French) on my website with something stupid. I'll try to find the courage and time to explore more and add content to this section.
* It seems that the "News from last month" posts are read by other persons than me (or you are a lot in my head), I will continue that. Maybe try to finally automate it a little bit (the workflow has already been improved).

I have my domains on AWS since years because I was using [up](https://apex.sh/up/) to deploy everything. Up is an amazing tool but I switched to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for my deployments. I can now move my domains out of AWS (to [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/)).

Last year I also set up [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) for my wife and I. I also tried 1Password (because of [Masked Email with Fastmail](https://fastmail.blog/privacy-security/masked-email-from-fastmail-and-1password-protects-your-identity-online/)) but I prefer Bitwarden. I will write about masked email in a future article.

As usual I did some amazing contribution to open source projects:

* [mdn/translated-content](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content/pull/889)
* [tektoncd/catalog](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/pull/713)
* [ straight-shoota/crinja](https://github.com/straight-shoota/crinja/pull/38)
* [Canop/broot](https://github.com/Canop/broot/pull/307)
* [nim-lang/Nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/13015)

### Cycling

Lazy year was lazy !

Strava says I did 1267kms; a lot less than last year, but I did some nice rides:

* [Gen√®ve => Gen√®ve (üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 180.11km)](https://www.strava.com/activities/5027197489)
* [Le Sal√®ve de long en large (üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 75.9km,  üöµ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 1801m)](https://www.strava.com/activities/5674880193)
* [Gen√®ve <=> Samo√´ns (üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 101.8 km)](https://www.strava.com/activities/5792333097)
* [Gen√®ve => Col de la Colombi√®re => Annecy => Gen√®ve (üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 138.51km, üöµ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 2039m)](https://www.strava.com/activities/5910472999)
* [Gen√®ve => Bellegarde => Col de la faucille => Gen√®ve (üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 115.06km, üöµ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 1807m)](https://www.strava.com/activities/6161214080)

### Cooking

I continued cooking for a few months, I made some breads and I have never felt so French! I had to stop for a few months for personal reasons but now I can get back into it. Yeah!

![Some bread](/contentful/5m13NvLj1ZecSTI5c9IbtM/940deb9472ad9193c762fa15bf72bb16/IMG_6533.jpg)

I also upgraded my cookies level and I am getting close to what I want: some sabl√©s which are cooked but not brown. Still a few tests to do :).

### Travelling

We were able to go to France to see the family a few times.

We also went to Fribourg in July:

![Fribourg](/contentful/6PsLYbiwJ7nwWh3J4g90hq/962ace48fff1ebcf68d61965bdf43cf1/IMG_7414.jpg)

And Thun / Bern in September:

![Thun](/contentful/4bvpNYanEiXrEher3ddlad/349b056f32fbf65dec028cbd74315671/IMG_7907.jpg)

We also went to the Mus√©e Rath, part of the Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire de Gen√®ve for a t√™te √† t√™te with some art pieces, it was amazing:

![La Toilette d‚ÄôAtalante from James Pradier at the Mus√©e Rath (Gen√®ve)](/contentful/4yIArVbi7lo6mbCP0a3RMX/e23f2ee708ea735ffee79cee2d3eb0fc/IMG_7486.JPG)

### Various

I started doing some crochet to make a beanie for the baby (this is the moment when you say "whaaaat" and yes, we have a daughter now). I have been quite lazy at the end of the year. I have to finish a cardigan for my wife.

I also bought a nice ukulele but I don't have much time to practice.

## Entertainment

### Books

Still spending to much time reading stuff on the Internet... But here are some books I finished last year:

- [Grokking Simplicity - Taming complex software with functional thinking](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-simplicity)
- [The Story of the Streets](https://www.penguin.com.au/books/the-story-of-the-streets-9781446486733)
- [Capital and Ideology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_and_Ideology)
- [RESET: Reclaiming the Internet for Civil Society - RONALD DEIBERT](https://deibert.citizenlab.ca/2020/11/reset-reclaiming-the-internet-for-civil-society/)
- [Ise, po√©tesse et dame de cour - Editions Picquier](https://www.editions-picquier.com/ouvrage/ise-poetesse-et-dame-de-cour/) (in French)

And I am in the middle of [La Horde du Contrevent](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Horde_du_Contrevent) (in French).

In 2022 I want to read [Warez: The Infrastructure and Aesthetics of Piracy](https://punctumbooks.com/titles/warez-the-infrastructure-and-aesthetics-of-piracy/).

### Games

* [WHAT THE GOLF?](https://www.whatthegolf.com/) is great! Innovative and fun, and WTF.
* [Cozy Grove - come for the view, stay for the friends](https://cozygrovegame.com/): cute but a bit boring. The objects to find are often too small (played on my phone) and cooking requires rare items which is quite frustrating.
* [#DRIVE - An Endless Driving Video Game](https://www.drive.game/), it is nice!
* A lot of [Good Sudoku](https://www.playgoodsudoku.com/)
* Started [CyberPunk 2077](https://www.cyberpunk.net/), it is not as fun as I expected. Some things are too complex for nothing (braindance, body mods, hacking...), other elements make the game a bit boring (capabilities when upgrading levels, driving which feels a bit clunky, dialogs are so slow I spent more time sitting and talking to NPCs than actually doing things). I almost stopped but got hooked when Keanu Reeves arrives in the game.
* Started [Watch Dogs 2](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-2): I really enjoyed the first one, and I like the start of this one!

## Happy new year!

> Happy New Year to all those who will have a good year. Good luck and hang in there for the others, 2023 will be there promptly.

If you are still reading, know that I love you very much. Let's end this with a lovely song: [black midi - John L - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT0nSp8lUws)
