description: An interesting newsletter I received

OH HAI !

I recently subscribed to the [http://www.tofugu.com/](http://www.tofugu.com/) newsletter. This website is about japanese culture, in a geeky humorous way.

This is the first time I receive such a message, it was uber fun and it totally made my day. I wish I could see something like this more frequently.

Here is the confirmation message I received :

> TODO Siegfried!<br>
> <br>
> I know a whole, entire day has gone by since you signed up for the Tofugu Newsletter already, but I didn't know about it until this morning, when Tofugu's on-call Buddhist Monk shook me awake this morning screaming:<br>
> <br>
> "Siegfried! Siegfried HAS SIGNED UP TO OUR LIST!"<br>
> <br>
> "TODO!??" ("WHATT!??") I screamed back, jolted totally awake.<br>
> <br>
> We both knew what this meant. We ran over to the Tofugu Temple (also rented out just for this purpose) and gave high-fives to the other monks there. They had heard about your recent newsletter sign-up as well. Taking your name from the printer one of the monks began etching your name and email onto a golden plank. While this was going on, myself and the other monks were cheering him on. As the last letter in your email address was finally put down, we gave each other high fives and hugs again. This, literally, was the best day of our lives. I mean, after all,_you_, Siegfried, signed up for our mailing list. Thank you so much for making our day.<br>
> <br>
> Then, after a whole day of cheering and whooping and doing jumping double-handed chest bumping high fives with the Buddhist monks, I drug myself back home to my computer, where I wrote this email. I'm so tired from thecelebrating, but I'm ready to help you if I can. Feel free to shoot me an email any time if I can do anything for you (Japanese help? Japanese resources help? Etc.) and I'll see what I can do! : )<br>

> Cheers,<br>
