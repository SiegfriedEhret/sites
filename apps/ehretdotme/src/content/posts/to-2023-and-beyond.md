Hello folks, I hope you are doing well.

## Work

We released [Cyber Attacks in Times of Conflict Platform #Ukraine](https://cyberconflicts.cyberpeaceinstitute.org/). The website is made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), we followed the hype and used [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) (I don't think we will do that again). We use Go for the API and it is deployed on Kubernetes (true story) using a custom Helm Chart. So many buzzwords! 

We also updated the theme on our website, we use [Krowd](https://themeforest.net/item/krowd-crowdfunding-charity-wordpress-theme/26963792) with a set of colours and fonts - can we call this "design"? - instead of the same theme ^^ (but it was tweaked in strange ways so we were not able to apply updates).

I converted a few coworkers to matcha, quite proud of that.

In 2023 I'll look into data management and pipelines, quite exciting!

I also became a CxO! We had a lovely intern so I was the Chief Guillaume Officer. We spent 6 months together and it was a lot of fun. We worked together on the following:

* Deployment and configuration of a [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) platform
* Automatic retrieval and translation of articles from the [Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine](https://cert.gov.ua/articles).
* A set of tools to dump data from a website, push it to a database, and an app on top of it to display the content.

Good job Guillaume!

## Not work

Lazy year was lazy (well, busy with something more important ^^), so I have not cycled much (but I will in 2023!).

I [quit Twitter](https://ehret.me/bye-twitter) on May 1st following the acquisition announcement and I don't regret it. This was followed by a set of rules I try to respect to be less "connected". I wrote a bit about this on my French website: [Quelques pas vers un monde libre de distractions](https://sieg.fr/ied/quelques-pas-vers-un-monde-libre-de-distractions)

I kept on publishing my "News from last month" articles, I think it is useful for a few more people than me. Cool!

I finally took the time to make my MacBook Air (2021, Intel) usable by installing Linux on it (thanks to [this](https://wiki.t2linux.org/)). I went with [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) because I am lazy. I use Arch - almost - btw.

I am still cooking a bit and baking some cakes! I improved on the cookies game, and started playing with some [financiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financier_(cake)). This will continue in 2023.

## Travels

We were able to go to Japan (after a cancellation from Air France the day before because Russia, we went with Etihad) for a few weeks.

I highly recommend going to Japan when tourists are not allowed, we were able to go to the top of Sky Tree and it was almost empty:

We also went to Paris and Lyon to visit some friends and family.

For the summer holidays, we went to Vevey / Montreux, then Gstaad, and Gruyères. We took the [Belle Époque train from Montreux to Gstaad](https://mob.ch/activity/belle-epoque/?lang=en) because [i really like to ride the train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KjrrBaNljg):
