I wanted to do some WebGL stuff, and came accross [BabylonJS](http://www.babylonjs.com/).

So I am starting a serie of experiments, trying to copy THE reference [Nehe OpenGL lessons](http://nehe.gamedev.net/tutorial/lessons_01__05/22004/).

This is the part 0, explaining how to get everything up and running.

> WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins.
> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL)

You need a modern browser:

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
- [Internet Explorer 11](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie-11-release-preview)

You can find more information [here](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?p=11).

Then, since I want to play with BabylonJS, you should first go see their [website](http://www.babylonjs.com/) where they have **amazing** examples, and then the [github page](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js) to download it.

Please check [the basic tutorial](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/wiki/01---Basic-scene) to try it.

The files for all lessons are [here](https://github.com/SiegfriedEhret/webgl-experiments).
