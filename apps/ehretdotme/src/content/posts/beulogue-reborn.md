## Farewell, Hugo !

I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for a few months / years and it's great. I am not crazy about the templating part of it and I was starting to look for alternative. I tried [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) which is also great but didn't meet my expectations regarding multilingual sites.

So I started my own thing... Again...

## Enter `beulogue`

> `beulogue` [\bøloɡ\]: french for blog.

`beulogue` is an experiment to discover the [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) programming language, 2 years after playing with [the same concept with Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/beulogue).

The repository is [github.com/SiegfriedEhret/beulogue](https://github.com/SiegfriedEhret/beulogue).
