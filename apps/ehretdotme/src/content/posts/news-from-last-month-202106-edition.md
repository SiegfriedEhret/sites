## Before we start 2
A friend asked me previously about these "News from last month" posts. Here are a few details!

I like to read news and other articles. This is part of many moments in my day. Maybe too many moments, that is another story. When I read something interesting, that I want to keep track, I send it to my [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in).

I go through all links again when the time comes to write these articles, to make sure all links are still valid. This part is not automated (yet). I started adding [tags](https://pinboard.in/howto#tags) to most of the links, I need to play a bit with the [API](https://pinboard.in/api/v2/overview) to generate the list automatically.

In all categories, a lot of links come from Reddit and Twitter, also from some friends, and a few newsletters. For example:

* A lot of design related links are either from [Sidebar](https://sidebar.io/)
* I often steal links from [emmy·in·the·mix](https://emmyinthemix.com/)'s "Tea break" posts
* [Frontend Horse](https://frontend.horse/): Techniques to get you galloping
* [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/newsletter/): great articles about many technical things

I am aware of [The Last Web Page](https://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/TheLastWebPage.html), but I refuse to open it yet!
