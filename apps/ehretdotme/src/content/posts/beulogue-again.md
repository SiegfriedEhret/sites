> beulogue [\bøloɡ\]: french for blog.

## Why beulogue ?

I released [beulogue](https://gitlab.com/SiegfriedEhret/beulogue) a few months ago with a [small post](https://ehret.me/beulogue.html).

beulogue is my small attempt of doing stuff myself, with a few things in mind:

- it is a side project, so who cares about tests
- the code is kind of crappy
- it works on my computer !

## What now ?

beulogue just reached v3.0.0, because bumping to [Node.js v6](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a breaking change.

Learn more about [versioning](http://semver.org/).

## What after ?

beulogue works pretty well for my needs, if you ever try it (but I think I am its only user ^^), please go to [gitlab.com/SiegfriedEhret/beulogue](https://gitlab.com/SiegfriedEhret/beulogue).

I have a few ideas for beulogue future:

- bring it a few friends:
  - a GUI to manage articles, assets and templates (using [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) or [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/))
  - a tool to sync to a distant server
- make it plugin friendly
