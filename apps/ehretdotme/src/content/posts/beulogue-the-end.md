## Once upon a beulogue...

beulogue is my go-to project when I want to dig more into a language and its ecosystem.

In 2015, the first beulogue came to life and it was made with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

In 2019, it was retired and the second beulogue was unleashed on Earth and more (if you have an Internet access). It was my first real-life project with [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).

Today is the end of the second beulogue.

## But alors, you abandon us?

Haha no, I am abandoning myself since I was the only user!

Even if beulogue will not be developed anymore in its current form, a third one may see the light one day!

Starting now, the current [repository](https://github.com/SiegfriedEhret/beulogue), [documentation](https://beulogue.ehret.me/en/), [templates](https://github.com/SiegfriedEhret/beulogue-templates) and [Docker action](https://github.com/SiegfriedEhret/beulogue-action) are not maintained anymore.

You can still use it and the documentation will stay available.

## And this website?

This website has been over-engineered for fun (and no profit).

- The content is hosted on [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
- The website is made with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

⚠️ sadly, the RSS feeds links have changed, please update!

- For the English part: https://ehret.me/en/index.xml is replaced by [https://ehret.me/en/rss.xml](https://ehret.me/en/rss.xml)
- For the French part: https://ehret.me/fr/index.xml is replaced by [https://ehret.me/fr/rss.xml](https://ehret.me/fr/rss.xml)

## That's all folks!

beulogue is the second project I stopped this year, after [brrr](/en/brrr-the-end). This is give me more time for a new secret project about writing.

Stay tuned for 2 articles in the near future about:

- The new workflow
- The secret project

Thank you! Love.
