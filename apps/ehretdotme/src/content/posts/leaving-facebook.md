## Cool story bro, but why ?

Mostly because I think these are more insteresting than facebook, which is full of shitty ads and videos instead of news about my friends.

## But where can I reach you ?

Note: I have not left these other platforms yet :-)

- on [keybase](https://keybase.io/siegfriedehret), where you can check some places where I am.
- on [twitter](https://twitter.com/SiegfriedEhret) for IT thingies.
- on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siegfriedehret/) for pro stuff (my profile is weird on purpose and everything is true).
- on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/SiegfriedEhret): the frontpage of the internet !

If you want to chat, I am on:

- on [telegram](https://telegram.org/) / [Signal](https://signal.org/), please contact me by another way and I'll give you my phone number.
- on [LINE](https://line.me/): my id is `siegfriedehret`

## See ya

Yep.
