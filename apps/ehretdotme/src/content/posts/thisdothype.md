Last month, [@thisdotmedia](https://twitter.com/thisdotmedia) hosted an interesting «thisdotjavascript» event, bringing people from popular libraries and framework together:

[![thisdothype stream screenshot](/contentful/1DI4ZTYuqjaRshRRqYOIEU/5987e861316654e27f8be4cdaa1f0805/screenshot.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InOWBvseRYU)

This was really cool and I started following the host twitter account.

The first thing I found strange is that the dude from RxJS is here. It is interesting, but kind of misplaced in this hangout with people working on frameworks / plaforms.

Then... Sponsoring some things and not all. I made a small program called [thisdothype](https://gitlab.com/SiegfriedEhret/thisdothype), and this is the result (until february, 18th):

It's a graph, so there is science behind it, and the results are clear: RxJS and Angular are the great winners of this propaganda.

Where are the people behind some other frameworks ? For example:

- [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), which succeeded in its purpose, but is suffering from not being a hipster framework anymore.
- [Inferno](https://www.infernojs.org/), the benchmark slayer, whose creator has been swallowed by Facebook (to make React fast ?).
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), whose creator should be swallowed by Facebook (to make react small ?).
- [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/), the auto-ejectable framework.

And what should we do about these ones ?

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), still everywhere.
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/), still everywhere.
- [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/), to code functionally.
- [Monet](https://cwmyers.github.io/monet.js/), to code functionally.
- [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/), lodash before lodash.

So I heard you like build tool chains:

- [Broccoli](http://broccolijs.com/), the lesser known one.
- [Brunch](http://brunch.io/), the lesser known other one.
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), the configuration dude.
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), the code dude.
- [Plop](https://plopjs.com/), the yeoman alternative.
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), the scaffolder.

And module bundlers !

- [FuseBox](http://fuse-box.org/), the new one.
- [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/), the tree shaking trend initiator.
- Webpack ([version 1](https://webpack.github.io/docs/) and [version 2](https://webpack.js.org/)).

All this often requires [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [ied](http://gugel.io/ied/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)...).

Will they be on air at some time ?

The fact that some people favor a few technologies and their «thought leaders», and that being «buddies» is the only way to reach people and be advertised, is one of the roots of the JS Fatigue I deeply feel since a few months.

From a co-worker:

![thisdothype buddies](/contentful/7GYFKuAXMeu9Rnw64nPSwX/9f6b759b5ad8aa5538ebf291356c1211/buddies.png)

> For the first webinar. Tracey invited her buddies. And Ben is one of them. It's that simple.

Should the uninvited frameworks be considered dead ? Fuck.

There will be [another session](http://thisdot.co/javascript) on 2/18th, with... The same people as in the first episode:

![thisdotjavascript](/contentful/puUu5ALMULpxSSGF0L9BI/b2ef1c146a8b9b49a4e2ad1a50bf65d8/thisdotjavascript.jpg)

Wait & see...
