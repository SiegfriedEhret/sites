## Android

I use [CyanogenMod](http://cyanogenmod.org/) without the signed Google apps (available somewhere on the interwebs).

And I have not added my old Gmail account... So how to survive on Android without the Store ?

## Software

- Firefox: epic browser is epic
  - [Aurora channel](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/aurora/)
  - [Classic channel](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mobile/releases/latest/android/multi/)
- [Spotify](http://download.spotify.com/android/SpotifyAndroid.apk) for music
- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk), a Google Play Store alternative
- [Tweetlanes](https://github.com/chrislacy/TweetLanes/releases/) for Twitter
- Facebook... in Firefox

On F-Droid:

- K9Mail: a very nice email client
- Barcode Scanner: QRcode
- RMaps: amazing maps
- Pinboard: to manage bookmarks and stuff to read later. See [here](http://pinboard.in/)
- Anki: to learn stuff
- yaxim / xabber / gibberbot: xmpp and jabber client (for gtalk)

On Firefox, I went on their [addons catalog for mobile firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/android/) and installed the [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) plugin.

## Contacts

I actually use [OwnCloud](http://owncloud.org/) so I imported my Gmail contacts into it.

I can then use [CardDav](http://dmfs.org/carddav/?getit) (there is a direct link to the apk file) to sync them on the phone.
More info on [OwnCloud manual](http://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/user_manual/contacts.html#keeping-your-address-book-in-sync)

## But... Games ?

You **should** have a nice [Humble Bundle](http://humblebundle.com/) collection... And they have a [nice app](https://www.humblebundle.com/app) to download and install your stuff.

## But alors... All the stuff I bought on the Play Store ?

[Apk downloader](http://codekiem.com/2012/02/24/apk-downloader/) is your friend, it can help you retrieve apps from your account, but it's against the Google Play Store policy. And you can't download everything.

## Still missing

- [Mightytext](http://mightytext.net/) a web app connected to the Google Account from the phone to easily send text messages with your favorite browser.
- A **good** japanese keyboard, so I'm still using the [Google Japanese Input ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.japanese)

## What next ?

I talked about F-droid, but you may consider the [Amazon App Store](http://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get-appstore/android). You may not trust Amazon if you don't trust Google, but Amazon is (I think), more interested in selling you digital content rather than in leaking your information.

## Finally... Why ?

I didn't want to bother you with my ideas at the beginning of this page.

I think Google is still an amazing company making amazing things (Google Glass, self driving cars...), but they made some choices recently that I do not like.

What made me change my mind about them was the dramatic shutdown of Google Reader. So I tried to find an alternative, and then alternatives to other products.

Here are some things I use know:

- Google Reader -> [Tiny Tiny RSS](http://tt-rss.org)
- Gmail -> [FastMail](http://fastmail.fm/)
- Google Maps -> [Open Street Map](www.openstreetmap.org) or (sorry) [Bing Maps](http://www.bing.com/maps/)
- Picasa / G+ albums: not found yet. I tried Flickr, but I am not really convinced. [OwnCloud](http://owncloud.org/) may do the job
- Drive -> [OwnCloud](http://owncloud.org/) or [Hubic](https://hubic.com)
- Agenda -> [OwnCloud](http://owncloud.org/)
