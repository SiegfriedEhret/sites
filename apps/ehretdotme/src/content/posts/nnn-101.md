[nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/) is a sweet terminal file manager. It looks like this:

[![Image from the official nnn repository](/contentful/1pPlhL7vJoZWA3JAwmHmhr/bc2252da430c3f26fedec4fe2dead745/nnn.png)](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/)

We are going to use plugins, check if you have the files in `~/.config/nnn/plugins/`. If not, clone [the repository](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/) and copy them from the `plugins` folder.

## Browsing

Use the arrow keys or the good old `h` `j` `k` `l` keys if you do not want to leave your [home row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing#Home_row).

For folders, `left`/`right` and `h`/`l` allow to go up and down in the tree. When you are on a file, use `right` or `l` to open the file (see the "Open everything" part a little bit further).

## Tabs

See the `[1 2 3 4]` at the top of the image at the beginning of this article? They are tabs.

Use your keyboard's numbers to activate a tab and switch to it. `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` allows to cycle through activated tabs.

## Open everything

The [nuke plugin](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/blob/master/plugins/nuke) allows to open some files with a range of applications.

Here are a few elements (see the full list in the [plugin comments](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/blob/master/plugins/nuke)):

- pdf: zathura (GUI), pdftotext, mutool, exiftool
- audio: mocplay (nnn plugin using MOC), mpv, media_client (Haiku), mediainfo, exiftool
- avi|mkv|mp4: smplayer, mpv (GUI), ffmpegthumbnailer, mediainfo, exiftool
- htm|html|xhtml: w3m, lynx, elinks
- json: jq, python (json.tool module)
- image/*: imv/sxiv (GUI), viu (https://github.com/atanunq/viu), img2txt, exiftool
- video/*: smplayer, mpv (GUI), ffmpegthumbnailer, mediainfo, exiftool
- audio/*: mocplay (nnn plugin using MOC), mpv, media_client (Haiku), mediainfo, exiftool

```shell
export GUI=1
export NNN_OPENER=~/.config/nnn/plugins/nuke
```

I use the `GUI=1` variable because I can't live without [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) and [mpv](https://mpv.io/).

Tell `nnn` to use a CLI opener:

```shell
nnn -c
```

Then, when you hit `right` or `l` on a file, it will be opened with your favorite application.

## Fuzzy find

I use the [fzopen](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/blob/master/plugins/fzopen) plugin which allows to find a file in the current subtree to open it (remember the "Open everything" part? :smile:).

```shell
export NNN_PLUG='o:fzopen'
```

Then, use `;` (the "start a plugin" key) then `o` (the key set in `NNN_PLUG`). Then, just type the name of the file you are looking for and voilÃ !

### File preview

I use the [preview-tabbed](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/blob/master/plugins/preview-tabbed) plugin. The [preview-tui](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/blob/master/plugins/preview-tui) is also a possibility.

We need to have [tabbed](https://tools.suckless.org/tabbed) installed.

```shell
export NNN_PLUG='t:preview-tabbed'
```

Tell `nnn` to use an automatic fifo file for the plugin:

```shell
nnn -a
```

Or set the path to one with the `NNN_FIFO` environment variable and run `nnn`.

Then, use `;` (the "start a plugin" key) then `t` (the key set in `NNN_PLUG`). I use [i3](https://i3wm.org/), a tiling window manager, so the screen gets split automagically to display the preview. You can then browse your files and the preview window will be updated.

### Images

[viu](https://github.com/atanunq/viu) is quite a fun tool to display an image in a terminal. And `nnn` has the [imgviu plugin](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/blob/master/plugins/imgview) for that!

```shell
export NNN_PLUG='v:imgviu'
```

Then, when you are on an image, use `;` (the "start a plugin" key) then `v` (the key set in `NNN_PLUG`). Enjoy this pixel art of your images! 

## Icons

Since version 3.4, `nnn` can display icons. You just need... [to compile `nnn`](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Advanced-use-cases#file-icons)!

## Key bindings

Type `?` and you will see the keys you can use.

The wiki has a [graphical map](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Usage#graphical-map).

Want to change the bindings? Just change them in the source and [compile `nnn`](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Advanced-use-cases#file-icons)!

## The end

Here is the whole configuration I currently use:

```shell
export NNN_OPENER=/home/user/.config/nnn/plugins/nuke
export NNN_PLUG='o:fzopen;v:imgviu;t:preview-tabbed'
export GUI=1
alias nnn="nnn -a -c"
```

I really enjoy `nnn`, it is really fast compared to [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) on my old computer.

Not having a configuration file is disturbing at the beginning, and maybe it is a force to make sure the configuration does not grow into a neverending list.
