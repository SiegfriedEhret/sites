(sorry, this is again a rant about some Angular thing...)

What is the difference between:

![angularjs old](../../../public/assets/contentful/5xhW8Ivq8MwrTSGfvhQl96/566dc2c5397970ddc7b20e080d16dd9b/angularjs-old.png)

and

![angularjs new](../../../public/assets/contentful/1EWdiXVJy5fm66xcle8bco/3122d186ea8d162091f542ff7779a1ed/angularjs-new.png)

?

Yep. The search bar was removed from the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) website.

## Why ?

From a coworker (Google fanboy):

![Why Angular why](../../../public/assets/contentful/1Wx6vEMZpK9UwCAn2pSacd/2e016576dc01fc259d5be2e389858995/le-why.png)

> We are starting to re-route people to [angular.io](https://angular.io/)

## Whaaaaaaaat ?

As I see it, the Angular team wants to make access to AngularJS things harder, starting with reaching the documentation.

I can't wait to see their next move.
