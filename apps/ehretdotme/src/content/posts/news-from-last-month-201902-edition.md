Something strange is happening. In the last few months, multiple projects switched to TypeScript ([jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/7554), [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6953), Vue.js)... I like to have choices (vim vs emacs, space vs tabs...) and having TypeScript taking over the world of [languages that compile to JS](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS) is a problem. I really hope [Flow](https://flow.org/) will get back on tracks because I don't think the world is ready for [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/).
