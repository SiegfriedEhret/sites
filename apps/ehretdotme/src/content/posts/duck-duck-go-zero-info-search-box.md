## intro

Update : january 17, 2012 : this plugin has been slightly modified. I had problems with reserved words. My mistake !
I always wanted to do a jQuery plugin. Now, it is done !

## what

This is a jQuery plugin for [Duck Duck Go Zero-click Info API](https://duckduckgo.com/api.html).
For those who are not familiar with [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/), it is my new favorite search engine. Go try it !

It provides a box with some basic info (like from wolfram alpha, wikipedia etc.).

## where ?

It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SiegfriedEhret/jddg).
Last version is v0.3 : try it [here](http://dev.federalbureauofinhumanity.org/jddg/v0.3/demo/) (broken link).

## ending

I will make some tests to make it better (but I do not like tests... Sorry) and add more parameters soon.
Stay tuned !

And don't forget to use [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/) !
