🎉 I started a new project. It is a package manager called `brrr` which is fast (compared to brew). Here are some links:

- [`brrr`](https://git.sr.ht/~siegfriedehret/brrr): the client.
- [freezer](https://git.sr.ht/~siegfriedehret/freezer): a repository of package definitions.

It is quite unstable for now and packages are mostly for Linux, but I'll try to put more MacOS apps. "It works on my computer" ™️.
