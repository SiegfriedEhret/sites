Following the recent news of acquisition by Elon Musk, I will be closing my Twitter account.

I want to believe that Elon Musk's desires to make the platform more open will be beneficial to it, but I want to get away from the properties of this person.

Reminder: [Elon Musk Is Not Your Friend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pNL7MlUpmI&t=1155s)

## After Twitter?

I think that a salutary evolution for Twitter is the work done around [Bluesky](https://blueskyweb.xyz/) (see also [bluesky community / decentralized-ecosystem](https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community1/decentralized-ecosystem/-/blob/master/README.md)), but I don't think we will see that before a long time.

I have received my data archive and will process it, and use a [nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter) instance to get RSS feeds and continue following your adventures.

Today, we have other choices with the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse). On my side, I went with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and I am active here: [@SiegfriedEhret@mastodon.ehret.me](https://mastodon.ehret.me/@SiegfriedEhret).

Also:

- By email at siegfried (at) ehret.me
- By phone (ask me) and on Signal

## A note about Twitter Blue

I subscribed to [Twitter Blue](https://help.twitter.com/fr/using-twitter/twitter-blue) for a month. I was hoping to find an answer on 2 points that could be improved on the platform: the filter bubble and the ads. Today, Twitter Blue does not resolve them.

But we can change the app icon, awesome! (not). See the [Twitter Blue features](https://help.twitter.com/fr/using-twitter/twitter-blue-features).

And we can have an [NFT](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeton_non_fongible) profile picture. I followed [How do I set my NFT as my Twitter profile picture? – OpenSea](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415562648851-How-do-I-set-my-NFT-as-my-Twitter-profile-picture-) and [la FAQ NFT de Twitter Blue Labs](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-labs#nft) to create my [face](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/94280092380959674268864707305995911262207933975278668350284066836477749755905), and I see it in my wallet, but it does not work because it is not a real transaction. So the experience ends here, I do not want to go further in the huge scam that is the world of NFTs. If you read French, here is an [interesting article](https://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=nft) about NFTs.
