明けましておめでとうございます！今年も宜しくお願いします！

I wrote [last year](https://ehret.me/to-2015-and-beyond.html) about my plans for 2015. Let's see what happens and what I want for 2016.

Legend:

- &#9745; things I have done last year
- &#9744; things I have failed to do last year
- &#9733; new !

## &#9745; Writing

I wrote some articles on this blog (mostly about my experimentations and shitty side projects) and some reports for [sfeir](http://www.sfeir.com):

- [nodeconf](http://lemag.sfeir.com/nodeconf-eu-2015/)
- [dotCSS](http://lemag.sfeir.com/dotcss-2015-le-debrief/)
- [internal talks](http://lemag.sfeir.com/bouffe-front-decembre-2015/)

I'll continue to share things and try to contribute to other blogs for 2016.

> 20 years later - know exactly what that means.

## &#9745; Speaking

I gave some "corporate" talks:

- [CSS Shapes](http://slides.com/siegfriedehret/css-shapes/)
- [(AND (KEEP CALM) (HACK LISP))](http://slides.com/siegfriedehret/and-keep-calm-hack-lisp#/)
- [intro to nock and cucumber](http://slides.com/siegfriedehret/nock-and-cucumber#/)

We also launched the [CSS Paris meetup](http://www.meetup.com/fr/CSS-Paris/) with [Vincent](https://twitter.com/iamvdo) and [Damien](https://twitter.com/hikkyu).

Interlude: [打首獄門同好会 - 日本の米は世界一](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuU2bocSfDo) (a japanese song about japanese rice, which is the best in the world ^^)

## &#9744; Learning

Half done !

I dived a little bit into:

- react
- vuejs

And I had a very small insight of meteor.

Not achieved:

- The Practical Common Lisp chapter about macros.
- Machine Learning / Big Data things.

Interlude: [Bloqués - Le Jeu du Johnny Deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAW4jV1T0nw) (french word play)

## &#9733; Programming

I _finally_ invested some time into into some personal projects:

- [beulogue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/beulogue), a static site generator
- [jisho](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jisho), a command line japanese dictionary
- [get-chromium-apk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-chromium-apk), a tool to download chromium for android (not sure if working anymore :p)

This year, I will focus on:

- [jtutu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jtutu), to try to build a frontend JS framework thing
- [ikuzo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ikuzo), a secret project (command line)
- [yosh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yosh), the frontend part for ikuzo

## &#9745; Keep on

I still have my [app.net](https://alpha.app.net/siegfriedehret) account but I don't use it much. Everything of from last year is ok !

Interlude: [Peste noire - Dans ma nuit](https://vimeo.com/113376933) (french countryside black metal)

## Peace ?

This was last year post question, and my answer was «**Peace.**»

A lot of shitty events happened in France and elsewhere in 2015 (like every year before, and sadly it will be the same for the next ones) and I can't be optimistic about it.

Some music to calm your spirit and bring peace to all of you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2WH8mHJnhM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2WH8mHJnhM)
