After a few months using [Google Inbox](http://www.google.com/inbox/), I decided to delete the app and go back to my previous email setup.

So I am back to the current setup:

- [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com) for personal mails.
- [Gmail](https://gmail.com) for everything else.

## Inbox: the good parts

- The swiping thing on the mobile app.
- Delaying mails for later.
- Reminders.

## Inbox: the not so good parts

- I prefer my old manual classification, using labels and rules.
- No clear count of mails.
- I don't want to "touch" twice to create a new email.
- Seriously, infinite scrolling...
- [Still not available on every browser](https://twitter.com/SiegfriedEhret/status/568439937663545344).
- I like my labels to be always visible.

## What now ? The fun part

I decided to go through all my mails to classify them correctly. Only **15921** remaining !
