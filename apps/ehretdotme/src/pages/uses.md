⚠️ this is in progress ⚠️

## Hardware

- MacBook Air (intel), dual-boot with MacOS and [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) at home.
- MacBook Air M2 at work.
- I have only 1 keyboard, a Leopold FC660C. It is a-ma-zing. I would love an ortholinear keyboard with switches like the ones on the Leopold.
- I use a trackball: [Kensington Orbit Trackball](https://www.kensington.com/en-gb/p/products/control/trackballs/orbit-trackball-with-scroll-ring/).

## Software

Some MacOS apps I use:

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) as a launcher of many things.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) to manage my windows.
- [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) to remap some keys.
- [AltTab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/) because the default MacOS behavior is sooo bad.
- [Maccy](https://maccy.app/), a clipboard manager.

And not on MacOS only:

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to play with images.
- [Corel Aftershot Pro 3](https://www.aftershotpro.com/en/) to process photos.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for some notes and drafts.

And online services:

- My code is mainly on [sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~siegfriedehret) and I still have a few things on [GitHub](https://github.com/SiegfriedEhret/).
- My websites are deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
- I use [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/) for my domains.
- [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) for my RSS feeds.
- [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/) for music, also on MacOS and iOS.
- [Kagi](https://kagi.com/) as my primary search engine.

### Editor + Terminal

- I mainly use [JetBrains products](https://www.jetbrains.com/), with a pinch of [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) when I am too lazy to [kakoune](http://kakoune.org/) or [vim](https://www.vim.org/). I use the default themes.
- I use [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/) everywhere I can (editor, terminal, default monospace font in my browser...)
- My terminal is [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), using the [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) and [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/).

### Browser(s)

I currently use [Floorp](https://floorp.app/en) after many years of [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/developer/). I talked a bit about this in [On n'a pas assez de Firefoxes.](https://sieg.fr/ied/firefoxes) on my French website.

In parallel I am also using [Orion](https://kagi.com/orion/), but it is slower than Firefox on the old MacBook Air and a bit unstable.

For work things I use Chrome because I prefer to separate my concerns.

## Mobile

I have an old iPhone 8. I changed the battery once. It is starting to be a bit slow but that's ok for what I do.

Some apps I use:

- [Carrot Weather](https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/), the best meteo app ever (I haven't tried the other but voilà).
- [Finalist](https://finalist.works/), a nice app to dump tasks in a daily planner.
- [Calm](https://www.calm.com/), I am loving these sleep stories.
- [Lire](https://lireapp.com/) for my RSS feeds, connected to my Feedbin account.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) for the daily tasks and shoppping.
- [Firefox Focus](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/mobile/focus/) as my main browser. Yes I accept all your cookies because I trash them instantly. I also have [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/mobile/ios/) installed.
- [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) for Mastodon.
- [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) to listen to podcasts.
- [Signal](https://signal.org/) for messaging. I am `sieg.42`, ping me!

## Podcast

In 2024 we started a podcast called « [badidon](https://sieg.fr/ied/badidon) ».

We use:

- A [Yeti](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/streaming-gear/yeti-premium-usb-microphone.988-000103.html) microphone.
- [Audio Hijack](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) for the recording.
- [Fission](https://rogueamoeba.com/fission/) for editing.
- [Farrago](https://rogueamoeba.com/farrago/) to trigger a few sounds here and there.
