Hello folks,

I use [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) to host the content of my websites, and I am torn between continuing using it (I like it a lot) and bringing back the content info my repository.

I bumped into [this article](https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/trying-tinacms/) about [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/) and decided to try it. I am hyped as a llama.

Let's see how it goes, if you read this article it means that my website has not exploded in the process.

Also, I will progressively move back the content from Contentful to the repository so I am quite convinced that I will break my RSS feed. Again.

Cheers!
